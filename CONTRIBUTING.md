# 🤝 Contributing to Gimbalabs DRep Community Platform

### Welcome! 🎉
Thanks for taking an interest in contributing!  
We're building a platform to reactivate **Gimbalabs** as an active **DRep (Delegated Representative)** in Cardano governance.  
This MVP is an experiment in **transparency, community engagement**, and **democratic participation** in governance decisions.

Gimbalabs is a space for learning, experimenting, and building together on Cardano.  
We move fast, sometimes break things, and always welcome new energy.

**We're building together → fast, open, and community-driven.**

Every contribution matters — whether you write code, test features, give feedback, bring good vibes to Open Space, or just ask good questions.
